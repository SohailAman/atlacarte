            that we decide to promote on the Site (“Promoters” or, individually, “Promoter”) can display, for example,
            their menus and/or other information about their business and/or run promotions.

            4.2 Users can access the individual pages of all the Promoters featured on the Site and/or view and/or avail
            of any promotions which are being offered by Promoters.

            4.4 In order to avail of an offer, you will be asked to “Check-In” to a Promoter’s venue using your mobile
            device. In order to do this, you will be required to share your location with us. You will also have the
            opportunity to share pictures or posts on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter etc. and to rate the
            Promoter’s venue in question using our star rating system.

            the terms and conditions of business of that Promoter, as outlined in Section 7 below. We merely provide
            Promoters with a platform through which they can advertise and promote their business to users. Apart from
            the contract between you and us pursuant to these Terms and Conditions and our Privacy Policy, any
            contractual relationship is between you and the Promoter in question. We accept no responsibility or
            liability for any acts, errors or omissions by the Promoter and/or by you that may result in loss, damage,
            cost, claim, liability or expense to the Promoter or to you. If you are availing of a promotion being run by
            a Promoter, it is your responsibility to read and understand that Promoter’s terms and conditions of
            business and we accept no responsibility or liability for your failure to read and/or understand the
            Promoter’s terms and conditions of business.
